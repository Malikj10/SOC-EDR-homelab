## Configuring an Endpoint Detection & Response system for a Client Running Windows 11 (plus more!)

This project aims to simulate and analyze cyberattack scenarios in a controlled environment, using tools like Lima Charlie and Sliver to understand attack patterns, develop custom detection rules, and enhance incident response capabilities.

## First, for the simulation, I used a Windows 11 VM and an Ubuntu server VM with VMware workstation pro
üìùThis is a safe and controlled way to simulate real-world environments and cyber attack scenarios. Using virtual machines (VMs) ensures that any malicious activity is contained and doesn‚Äôt affect your actual operating system üìù

## For this project I used Lima Charlie as the EDR platform
üìùEmploying an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool like Lima Charlie is important. EDRs are crucial for detecting, investigating, and responding to cyber threats. üìù

## Using LimaCharlie I created and installed a sensor for the Windows 11 VM and also created an artifact collection rule

## I used SSH to connect to the Ubuntu server from my host machine, then downloaded Sliver for the C2 framework
üìùUsing SSH (Secure Shell) to manage the Ubuntu Server VM remotely is a secure method. It's also common practice in cybersecurity operationsüìù.

## In this part, I created a c2 payload and downloaded it to the Windows 11 VM
üìùBy deploying Sliver, a legitimate tool often used in adversary simulation and red teaming, I‚Äôve added realism to the project. This step lets me understand how malware communicates to a command and control (C2) server. üìù
![Create c2 Payload with Sliver](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/83474a080a0b37cd71fb594a16ddc4be9668589d/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/7%20use%20sliver%20to%20create%20a%20c2%20payload.png)
![Now download to Windows 11](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/ee5eaf0e4e2b6960480fd097d19aa0ddec2df8f7/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/8%20make%20a%20temprary%20web%20server%20to%20get%20the%20payload%20from%20one%20computer%20to%20the%20next.png)

## Once I start the malware, I can see the connection being made in the C2 platform and I can see the EDR in the RCHP portion

## We can take a look at our EDR platform and do the following actions.
-	Look for IOCs

-	Check the timeline

## Going back to the Sliver, I check the privileges to see if I have ‚ÄúSeDeBugPriv‚Äù
![Check Privs](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/ee5eaf0e4e2b6960480fd097d19aa0ddec2df8f7/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/14%20SeDeBugPriv%20is%20powerful%20and%20we%20have%20it.png)

## In Sliver, I attempted to dump the process ‚Äúlsass.exe,‚Äù and then I went to LimaCharlie to track down this process
üìùAdversaries might dump the lsass.exe process to obtain user credentials and authentication tokens, enabling network infiltration, privilege escalation, and persistent access. üìù
![lsass accesses by malware](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/ee5eaf0e4e2b6960480fd097d19aa0ddec2df8f7/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/15%20We%20can%20see%20lsass%20was%20accessed%20by%20our%20malware.png)

## In this environment, I decided I would like to be alerted if anything like this happened again, so I created a detection rule for this process
![build detection](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/9776066c020a8761a70b89d13c2e5fbf83f54f96/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/16%20build%20detection%20rule%20for%20lsass%20acess.png)
![test detection](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/9776066c020a8761a70b89d13c2e5fbf83f54f96/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/17%20testing%20rule%20against%20event%20.png)
![save rule](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/9776066c020a8761a70b89d13c2e5fbf83f54f96/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/18%20save%20rule.png)

## We can see that the rule works and will alert us if this happens again!
![rule working](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/9776066c020a8761a70b89d13c2e5fbf83f54f96/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/19%20detection%20rule%20working.png)

# With LimaCharlie I took this a step further by automating a response in the EDR.
## First, I used my Sliver C2 framework to shell into the Windows 11 VM and then attempted to delete shadows.
üìùAdversaries delete shadow copies to prevent data recovery after an attack, making it harder to restore encrypted or compromised files and increasing the efficacy of ransomware. üìù
![trying to delete shadows](https://github.com/Malikj10/SOC-EDR-homelab/blob/9776066c020a8761a70b89d13c2e5fbf83f54f96/SOC-EDR-homelab-Screenshot/20%20shell%20into%20the%20system%20with%20malware%20and%20delete%20shadows.png)
## Next we can see in the images provided that the default SIGMA rules installed into the Limacharlie detected this; now I will use this event to build my own response rule and deploy it.

In conclusion, the project successfully demonstrated the intricacies of cyberattack detection and response, highlighting the effectiveness of using advanced tools like Lima Charlie and Sliver in a simulated environment to develop and refine cybersecurity skills and strategies along with looking through telemetry.
